## Equity Groups Formation Meeting

# One: Intro (10 min)

I'll introduce myself and discuss our basic organizational structure for equity groups. Talk about different possible roles within the groups (organizational lead, caucus rep.), caucus meetings with other groups and Ada staff, lunch groups, Slack.

# Two: Group Goal Setting (10 min)

On the white board we'll write bulleted answers to the questions "what are our goals for these groups as a whole?" and "what are our goals for tonight?"  We'll leave those up throughout the meeting and refer back at the end.

# Three: Group Introductions and Directions for Signing Up (10)

I'll go over the list of groups discussed at the previous meeting. I'll represent them as best I can and explain that in the future, each group will always speak for themselves. (Another option would be to find student leaders in advance to get up and introduce each group themselves. This introduces another logistical step, though, and may not be the most equitable way of giving students the opportunity to decide if they want to lead.) On tables in a circle around the outside of the room, there will be labels for each group and sign-up sheets, including a space for email addresses and a space to indicate whether they're interested in taking on a leadership role in the group. There could be a couple completely blank labels and sign-up sheets where students can establish groups they feel are missing. (This could also happen verbally in the large group before we start.)

# Four: Sign-Up Mingle (20 min)

Students walk around the room checking out the different groups, chatting with each other about it as desired, and putting their names on the lists.

# Five: Group Introductions (5-10 min each)

After everyone has had time to look at group labels and put their names down (we can explain that this isn't binding), we tell them to return to the table of one of the groups they signed up for. This is an opportunity to introduce themselves in each group. After 5 or 10 min, I'll ask those who signed up for more than one group to switch tables. Those who signed up for just one will stay and meet any newcomers.

# Six: Reflections, Next Steps, Questions (20 min)

After a couple introduction rotations, we'll come back together as a large group. We'll let them know about next steps moving forward: 1.) I will collect all the sign-up sheets and create an email list for each group and send one email with a reiteration of our goals for the groups and the names of the students who have stepped up as leaders. 2.) After that, it's in their hands. They can set lunch/happy hour/coffee meetings as they feel is appropriate and establish their own private Slack. 3.) Ada staff will not participate in their organizing or meetings unless at their specific request. 4.) Announce the general time frame for the first inter-group caucus and the panel with Ada staff, which can be scheduled on a doodle with group reps after they start meeting.   I'll take any questions about these next steps.

Finally, we'll return to the goals we set at the beginning of the meeting. Did we accomplish our goals? Anything we still need to address as a group?





# Questions/Reflections about structure

+ Is it ok to have the sign-up process be so public and visual? Would there be a benefit to a more confidential option? Personally, I think the lack confidentiality is kind of the nature of having a public meeting about it, but I wonder if there are certain groups that may be uncomfortable with it. Of course, Students who don't want to sign up in public could always email us or the student group leaders later.

+ Will this "open floor" style of signing up feel too chaotic? I think it may be the most efficient, most independent, and least exposed method, but I want to consider whether it could feel like a logistical clusterF.

+ Do we put out sign-up sheets for all the groups suggested in the first meeting? Do we revisit this as a group on the day of?
