# Car and Driver

Trust-building activity: participants split into pairs, one becoming the "car" and one becoming the "driver." By tapping on either shoulder, the driver steers the blindfolded/eyes-closed car. Facilitator can set destinations, switch drivers, or create obstacles. Car and driver will switch so that participants can experience both.  Follow-up conversation about what it was like to surrender control to the driver or to be responsible for the safe movement of the car.
