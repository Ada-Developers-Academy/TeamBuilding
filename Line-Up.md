#"Line-Up"

Activity: Without speaking, participants line-up in order of birthday, from January to December. They must problem solve to figure out how they will communicate without words. Then make it trickier by lining up based on things like home state and alphabetical order of names.

Goals: practice communication and facilitate getting to know each other.
