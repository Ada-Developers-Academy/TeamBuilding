#Change-Maker

Activity: Participants create a circle with the person who's "It" in the middle. The pre-designated "change-maker" sets a simple repetitive action that everyone else in the group will copy. Whenever "It" isn't looking, the change-maker can change the action. "It" has 3 guesses to figure out who the change-maker is.
