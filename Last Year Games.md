#Bonding Activities

##Card Tower

**Duration** 30 minutes
**Materials** Deck(s) of Cards
**Description** Distribute a pack of cards and a pair of scissors to each group of 2-5 members. Instruct them to build the tallest card tower using ONLY the cards and scissors given to them. This will stimulate creativity and team bonding, as the team figures out how to build the tower with the limited material available. (Optional: Spice up the game with 1 A4 size piece of paper)

##Rose, Bud, Thorn

**Duration** 30 minutes
**Materials** N/A
Description This is an ice breaker to get the group talking. Each person says their name and then the three things they could categorize as a rose, bud and thorn.
Rose: something you're proud of
Bud: something you're learning or working on
Thorn: area of improvement

##M & M Game or Colors

**Duration** 30 minutes
**Materials** M&Ms or Skittles
**Description** Each person gets a bag of M&Ms or Skittles. For each color that they pull out, they answer a different question:
Red: Something about yesterday
Orange: Something you do well
Yellow: Something about your childhood
Blue: Something you learned last week
Brown: Something you can't live without
Green: Something you watch/listen to

##Mine Field

**Duration** 30 minutes
**Materials** Open space and "mines" (could be bottles, cones, books, etc.)
**Description** The idea behind this exercise is to improve team members’ trust, their relationship, and to communicate in a more effective way. You will need an open space such as an empty room or hallway in which you will distribute ‘mines’ that are placed haphazardly around the area. Team members are paired into teams of two. One team member will be blindfolded and the other can see and talk, but is not allowed to enter the field or touch their partner. The challenge is for the blind-folded person to walk from one side of the field to the other, avoiding the mines by listening to the verbal instructions of their partners. (Optional: Have more than 1 pair walking through the mine simultaneously, so the difficulty of focusing and listening to the right instructions increases)

##Zoom

**Duration** 30 minutes
**Materials** Zoom book as laminated sheets
**Description** This book features 30 sequential pictures that work together to form a narrative. Hand out one picture to each participant, making sure a continuous sequence is being used. Explain to the participants that they can only look at their own pictures and must keep their picture hidden from other participants. Time should be given for the participants to study their pictures because each picture will contain important information that will help the participants solve the problem of putting them into order. The ultimate goal is for the group to place the pictures in sequential order without looking at one another’s pictures. The participants can talk to each other and discuss what is featured in their picture. (Optional: Draw up your own pictures to accommodate the team size and difficulty level)

##Mind Meld

**Duration** 30 minutes
**Materials** N/A
**Description** Have students count to 40 in random order with eyes closed. Students should focus on active listening skills, deep focus, group mind. If multiple students say a number simultaneously, you start over.

##Good Thoughts Web

**Duration** 30 minutes
**Materials** String/Streamer/Ball
**Description** Everyone from the class circles up tightly, including the instructor(s). The instructor(s) starts by holding the yarn and choosing one person and remarking on something they like about their character. The teacher then will hold onto the strand of the yarn and pass the ball to that student. That student will repeat the process and hand it off to the next person. Repeat until everyone has been chosen once. If string is not available, feel free to just toss an object around instead, but keep track of who has been chosen. If you fear that one student won’t be chosen, ensure that person gets picked by having an instructor or volunteer choose them.

##Appreciations

**Duration** 30 minutes
**Materials** Students names on paper scraps in a hat/jar/box/etc.
**Scaffolding** Recommendations “I’m going to invite you to say something about Sally’s character, not appearances”
**Description** Have students choose a name from a hat (that is not their own). Students should prepare to publically acknowledge and appreciate the student they’ve chosen for something they've done throughout the program that helped them, someone else, or inspired them.

##Instant Best Friends

**Duration** 30 minutes
**Materials** N/A
**Scaffolding** Recommendations
1. Indicate that part of building a trusting environment is opening yourself up to trust others.
2. Explain the activity (3 minutes about yourself, telling everything that your very best friend knows about you, the other person only listens and does not interrupt)
3. Do a mini version, 1-2 minutes, of your own for the entire class in the style you hope to foster in your classroom.

##Warm and Fuzzies

**Duration** 15-30 minutes
**Materials** Pen and paper
**Description** Have students write their names at the top of a piece of paper and then pass it to the left. Have students each take 30 seconds to a minute to write nice things about that person on the paper before passing it again to the left. When you get your own paper back the activity is over.

##Winds Are Blowing

**Duration** 30 minutes
**Materials** Slides [Before start of internship and/or before start of next cohort]
**Description**
Find an outdoor space (or large indoor space if it is raining). Should you be in a space that you are comfortable taking off your shoes, have all participants take off their shoes. Otherwise, have students bring their bags/backpacks. Place all the shoes/backpacks in a circle and have students stand behind their pair of shoes. Remove one pair of shoes from the circle, and have that student stand in the middle of the circle. She must state a fact about herself in the following way: “The winds are blowing for anyone who was born in January”. All students, including the student in the center, for whom that is true must leave their shoes and run to another available pair that is non-adjacent. The student remaining standing is the next person to state a fact.

##Shout

**Duration** 10 minutes
**Materials** Not really a material - but best to do outside
**Description** Say that this class has lots of challenges, but we can get there together. Shout and it is not very loud by yourself. Then have the whole class shout and it is very loud. This sets the tone for a fun supportive environment, where students are less afraid to speak up and ask questions.

##Salt & Pepper (or Pairs)

**Duration** 15 minutes
**Materials** Prepared "pairs" on index cards, tape
**Description** As a facilitator, think of pairs of things such as, salt and pepper, yin and yang, shadow and light, peanut butter and jelly, Mickey and Minnie mouse, male and female, and so forth. Write each item on a piece of paper (i.e. salt on one piece and pepper on another), and tape one paper on the back of each person, making sure they can’t see it. When the game starts, everyone must walk around asking yes or no questions in order to find out what word they have taped to their backs. Once they figure that out, they need to find their other pair. Learning how to ask the right questions is the key. (Optional: The two will then sit down and learn three to five interesting facts about one another)
