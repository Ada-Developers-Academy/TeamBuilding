#Drawing Blind

Activity: Break participants off into pairs. One is given a paper and pen, the other a simple, but interesting drawing. The participant with the drawing must describe to the other how to reproduce it step by step. At the end, they can compare drawings and then the whole group will share. Discuss what was most challenging and what made communication successful.
